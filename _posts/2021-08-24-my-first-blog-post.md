Creating my first blog post during the onboarding stages of the Web Dev bootcamp.  I have been learning up to this point to seamlessly enter the bootcamp as prepared as possible while also leaving myself opportunities to see how others can teach me certain aspects.  I'm trying to combine many avenues (SoloLearn, FreeCodeCamp, Eloquent Javascript & Prework) to be in a position to approach the camp full steam ahead.  Looking forward to the challenge.
